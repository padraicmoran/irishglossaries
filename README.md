The early Irish glossaries _Sanas Cormaic_ (Cormac’s Glossary), O’Mulconry’s Glossary (_De origine scoticae linguae_), _Dúil Dromma Cetta_
(the Collection of Druim Cett) and the shorter texts _Loman_ and _Irsan_ are important resources for our understanding 
of the literary and cultural environment of medieval Ireland. These inter-related texts, compiled from the seventh or 
eighth century onwards, comprise several thousand headwords followed by commentary that ranges from single-word explanations 
to extended narratives running to several pages.

The Early Irish Glossaries Project was a three-year project (2006–2009) based in the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic 
at the University of Cambridge. The project produced this digital resource and a series of articles on the texts and contexts of 
early Irish glossaries (see Bibliography). An edition of both O'Mulconry's Glossary and _Irsan_ was published in 2019. Editions of 
other glossaries are in progress. 

## Technical development

The website was built in PHP (version 7) and MySQL. This repository includes an export of the entire MySQL database. To recreate the site, 
rename includes/connection_EXAMPLE.php as includes/connection.php and supply the approriate MySQL authentication details there.
